"Developers tend to find the BSD license attractive as it keeps legal issues "
"out of the way and lets them do whatever they want with the code. In "
"contrast, those who expect primarily to use a system rather than program it, "
"or expect others to evolve the code, or who do not expect to make a living "
"from their work associated with the system (such as government employees), "
"find the GPL attractive, because it forces code developed by others to be "

"potentially \"burying\" or orphaning the software. If you want to force your "

"A BSD license is not simply a gift. The question <quote>why should we help "
"our competitors or let them steal our work?</quote> comes up often in "
"relation to a BSD license. Under a BSD license, if one company came to "
"dominate a product niche that others considered strategic, the other "
"companies can, with minimal effort, form a mini-consortium aimed at "
"reestablishing parity by contributing to a competitive BSD variant that "
"increases market competition and fairness. This permits each company to "
"believe that it will be able to profit from some advantage it can provide, "
